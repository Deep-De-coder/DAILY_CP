'''Intuition
The problem asks us to generate all possible subsets of a given list of integers that may contain duplicates. Since the order of the integers in each subset does not matter and we need to generate all possible subsets without duplicates, we can use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of the integers.

Approach
We start by defining a recursive function backtrack that takes two arguments: start and subset. start is the index of the first integer in the current subset and subset is the current subset of integers.

We append subset to our result list res.

We then iterate over all integers from index start to the end of the list. If the current integer is equal to the previous integer, we skip over it to avoid generating duplicate subsets.

We call backtrack with start + 1 and subset + [nums[i]]. This explores all subsets that include the current sequence of integers in subset.

Finally, we call our recursive function with initial values of 0 for start and an empty list for subset.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n∗2n)O(n * 2^n)O(n∗2 
n
 )
The time complexity of this solution is O(n∗2n)O(n * 2^n)O(n∗2 
n
 ) because it generates all 2^n subsets of the list of integers and takes O(n) time to make a copy of each subset before adding it to the result list.

Space complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)
The space complexity of this solution is linear because we use a recursive function and in the worst case scenario, our recursion stack can grow up to a depth of n where n is the length of the list of integers'''
